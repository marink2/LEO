            <p>
            The mission of this project is to help bring free tutorship 
            and mentorship to racially and economically disadvantaged 
            communities in New Jersey. Racial minority communities underperform 
            in academics due to historical as well as current disadvantageous 
            policy making here in the Garden State. Dedicated tutoring and mentorship 
            can help make a huge impact on studentsâ€™ academic success.
